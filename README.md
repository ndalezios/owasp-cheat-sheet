My OWASP cheat sheet \
\
These are my higlights and personal notes on reading _OWASP Testing Guide v4.0_ \
During reading this book, taking notes helps me memorize and have a better understanding of every concept. \
These notes contain parts copied straight from the book. \
You can use these notes as a checklist of what you already known on application security and on what you need to sharpen. \
Hope this helps you as it helps me \
